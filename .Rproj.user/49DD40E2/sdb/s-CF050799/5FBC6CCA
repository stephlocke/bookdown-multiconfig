We offer training, advice, and technical leadership to make sure things go more smoothly.\n\nFind out more about us at [itsalocke.com](https://itsalocke.com). \n\n\n\n\n<a rel=\"license\" href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/\"><img alt=\"Creative Commons License\" style=\"border-width:0\" src=\"https://i.creativecommons.org/l/by-nc/4.0/88x31.png\" /></a><br />This work is licensed under a <a rel=\"license\" href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/\">Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International License</a>.\n\n# The tidyverse\n## The tidyverse\nA collection of R packages designed to be consistent, clean interfaces to working with data in R.\n\nThe \"tidyverse\" was born from the \"Hadleyverse\". **Hadley** Whickham wrote some of the most widely adopted packages that are now in the tidyverse. \n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tidyverse/tidyverse/master/docs/logo.png)\n\n## Pipes\nOne of the most radical parts of the tidyverse that isn't part of base R is the concept of \"piping\", which was first introduced in [magrittr](https://cran.r-project.org/package=magrittr)\n\n```{r}\nmean(iris$Sepal.Width[iris$Species==\"setosa\"]*iris$Sepal.Length[iris$Species==\"setosa\"])\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\niris %>% \n  filter(Species == \"setosa\") %>% \n  summarise(mean(Sepal.Width*Sepal.Length))\n```\n\nUse ctrl+shift+m to easily get this operator\n\n## Variable assignment\nNormally with R, we use the left-hand side (LHS) assignment operator (`<-`) but when we use pipelines we tend to use the right-hand side (RHS) assignment operator (`->`).\n\n```{r}\nsetosas <- iris[iris$Species==\"setosa\",]\n\niris %>% \n  filter(Species == \"setosa\") ->\n  setosas\n```\n\n## Data positions\nPipelines work by passing the output of a function into the first argument in a function. Unfortunately, old R functions don't always adhere to this data first approach. We can use a `.` to specify where our data should go in such cases.\n\n```{r}\niris %>% \n  lm(Sepal.Length ~ Sepal.Width, data=.)\n```\n\n\n## Exercises\n1. Build a pipeline that gets the column names from `iris` and upper-cases them\n2. Build a pipeline that takes the `LETTERS` variable and uses `sub()` to replace `S` with `Z`, store this as a new variable called `LETTERZ`\n\n\n# Filtering\n## Filtering\nThe function we use to conditionally select rows from our data.frames is `filter()`. Comma seperate conditions to get an `AND` experience. Use the standard logical operators to get an alternative combination of conditions.\n\n```{r}\niris %>% \n  filter(Species==\"virginica\") %>% \n  nrow()\n\niris %>% \n  filter (Species == \"virginica\", Sepal.Length > mean(Sepal.Length)) %>% \n  nrow()\n\niris %>% \n  filter (Species == \"virginica\" | Sepal.Length > mean(Sepal.Length)) %>% \n  nrow()\n```\n\n## Exercises\n1. Write a filter that gets all rows from `iris` where an attribute of the sepal is smaller than average\n2. Write a filter that removes setosa irises from the iris dataset\n\n# Columns\n\n## Columns \nWe can work with columns using a few functions:\n\n- `select()` for selecting columns\n- `mutate()` for creating new columns or amending existing ones\n- `transmute()` doing a mutate and a select in one go\n\n## Select\nWe can specify a combination of columns and some useful helper functions to do selects of columns.\n\n```{r}\niris %>% \n  select(Species, Sepal.Length) %>% \n  colnames()\n\niris %>% \n  select(-Species) %>% \n  colnames()\n\niris %>% \n  select(Sepal.Width:Petal.Width) %>% \n  colnames()\n```\n\n\n## Select - helper functions\n\n```{r}\niris %>% \n  select(starts_with(\"S\")) %>% \n  colnames()\n\niris %>% \n  select(ends_with(\"s\")) %>% \n  colnames()\n\niris %>% \n  select(contains(\"Length\")) %>% \n  colnames()\n```\n\n\n## Exercises\n1. Write a `select()` that gets all the columns from iris starting with \"S\"\n2. Write a `select()` that gets all the columns from iris starting with \"P\" at the beginning of the data.frame and the other columns after them. *Hint - read `?select_helpers`*\n\n# Select - Stretch content!\n## Select - conditionally\nYou can also select columns based on the outcomes of functions applied to the data in the columns.\n\n```{r}\niris %>% \n  select_if(is.numeric) %>% \n  colnames()\n```\n\nYou can also perform a column name change as you go!\n```{r}\niris %>% \n  select_if(is.numeric, tolower) %>% \n  colnames()\n```\n\n## Exercises\n3. Write a `select()` that gets all the character columns from iris and upper-cases the column names\n \n## Mutate\nWe can use mutate to add and/or update columns. Unless you do an assignment back to the original object, it doesn't make any changes.\n\n```{r}\niris %>% \n  mutate(Sepal.Area = Sepal.Width * Sepal.Length, \n         Avg.Sepal.Area = mean(Sepal.Width)) %>% \n  head()\n```\n\n## Exercises\n1. Create an `irisImperial` with the numeric measurements converted to inches and the Species upper-cased\n\n# Mutate - Stretch content\n\n## Functions\nWe're going to be able to use make some ad-hoc functions inside our pipelines. When we're making pretty simple functions, we can use the tidyverse way. A tidyverse function starts with a `~` and uses our `.` to denote where the input value should go. If we want to make the function reusable, we can assign it to a variable.\n\n```{r}\nconvertToFahrenheit <- as_function(~ (. - 32) * (5/9))\nconvertToFahrenheit(c(32,101))\n```\n\n\n## Mutate - conditionally\nYou can also use some conditional functions to change multiple columns at once and we can use our `~` functions to do custom changes.\n\n```{r}\niris %>% \n  mutate_if(is.numeric, ~ . + rnorm(.)) %>% \n  head()\n```\n\n## Exercises\n1. Redo your `irisImperial` code using `mutate_if` functions\n\n# Aggregation\n\n## Aggregations\nTo aggregate in our pipelines, we can uses the `summarise()` function.\n\n```{r}\niris %>% \n  summarise(MeanSepalWidth=mean(Sepal.Width),\n            MeanSepalLength=mean(Sepal.Length))\n```\n\n## Exercises\n1. Find the min and max values for Petal.Length\n\n# Aggregations - stretch content\n## Aggregations - conditionally\nYou can perform aggregations on all columns meeting a criteria\n```{r}\niris %>%\n  summarise_if(is.numeric, mean)\n```\n\n## Exercises\n1. Get the range for each numeric variable in iris. Hint: Range outputs two values so you need to make a custom function that will concatenate the outputs of range.\n\n\n# Grouping\n\n## Grouping\nWe can group by columns using the `group_by()` function but it doesn't make a practical difference until we perform an operation after it. Actions like summarising will work within each group then.\n\n```{r}\niris %>% \n  group_by(Species) %>% \n  summarise(AvgSepalLength=mean(Sepal.Length))\n```\n\n## Grouping\nGrouping can also be useful for getting within group measures.\n```{r}\niris %>% \n  group_by(Species) %>% \n  mutate(TotalLengths=cumsum(Sepal.Length)) %>% \n  slice(c(1,50,51,100,101,150))\n```\n\n## Exercises\n1. In a pipeline, group by species, and add a column the provides the average Petal.Width\n\n# Grouping - stretch content\n## Grouping - conditionally\nWe can also do grouping conditionally!\n\n```{r}\niris %>% \n  group_by_if(is.factor) %>% \n  summarise_all(mean)\n```\n\n## Exercises\n1. In a pipeline, add a column that provides a flag for whether the Sepal.Length is below average, group by species and this below average flag, and get the maximum values for all numeric columns\n\n# Reshaping\n##  Wide or tall?\nIf your data is wide you have a row per observation with many measurements as columns. If your data is tall you have one row per observation's measurement.\n\n## From wide to tall\nTo go from wide to tall, we can use the `gather()` function.\n\n```{r}\niris %>% \n  mutate(flower=row_number()) %>% \n  # gather(measures name, values name, exclude any columns that are IDs)\n  gather(measure,value,-flower) ->\n  irisLong\n```\n\n## From tall to wide\nTo go from tall to wide, we use the `spread()` function.\n```{r}\nirisLong %>% \n  spread(measure, value) %>% \n  nrow()\n```\n\n## Exercise\n1. Convert the `who` dataset from wide to tall\n2. Convert the `population` dataset from tall to wide\n\n# Reshaping - stretch content\n\n## Splitting out variables\nSometimes multiple pieces of information are stored in a single value. We can use `seperate()` to split these into seperate columns.\n```{r}\nwho %>% \n  select(-starts_with(\"newrel\")) %>% \n  gather(measure, value, -(country:year),na.rm = TRUE) %>% \n  separate(measure,c(\"fact\",\"measure\",\"genderage\")) %>% \n  head()\n```\n\n## Exercises\n1. By reading the documentation for `separate()`, seperate out as much info as possible\n\n# Joining\n\n## Joins\nDifferent types of joins are:\n\n- **inner join** for getting only rows matched on both sides\n- **left join** for getting all the rows on the laft hand side with any matching data from the right\n- **full join** for getting all the rows on the left and the right with rows matched where possible\n- **anti join** for getting everything on the left where there's no match on the right\n- **cross join** for getting every row on the left joined against every row on the right\n\n## Join syntax\nWhen we join we withh pipes we need to know what we're joining, whether we can rely on doing that by name matching, and, if not, what fields we need to join by.\n\n```{r}\nirisLk<-data_frame(species=c(\"setosa\",\"virginica\",\"VERSICOLOR\"),\n                   colour=c(\"Red\",\"Blue\",\"Green\"))\niris %>% \n  left_join(irisLk, by=c(\"Species\"=\"species\")) %>% \n  dim()\n```\n\n## Joins\n```{r message=FALSE}\nirisLk<-data_frame(Species=c(\"setosa\",\"virginica\",\"VERSICOLOR\"),\n                   colour=c(\"Red\",\"Blue\",\"Green\"))\n\niris %>% left_join(irisLk) %>% dim()\n\niris %>% inner_join(irisLk) %>% dim()\n\niris %>% full_join(irisLk) %>% dim()\n```\n",
